As part of my undergraduate research fellowship at the University of Toronto's structural lab, I assisted with the visualization of reinforced concrete structures. The 3D X-Ray model of a steel-reinforced shear wall is shown in Figure 1, created in SketchUp. The model details the structure of the reinforced concrete shear wall and its internal steel reinforcements.

The cross-sectional drawing of the reinforced shear wall is shown in Figure 2, created in AutoCAD.

The cross-sectional drawing of the reinforced concrete pier is shown in Figure 3, created in AutoCAD. The drawing illustrates the steel reinforcement design within the concrete structure. Additionally, it indicates the locations of strain gauges used to measure displacement during a structural test.

The testing setup for the shear wall is shown in Figure 4, created in AutoCAD. The drawing illustrates a hydraulic actuator attached to the steel structural frame, which will exert top-loaded pressure onto the shear wall during the test.
