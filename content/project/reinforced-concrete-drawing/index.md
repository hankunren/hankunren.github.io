As part of my undergraduate research fellowship at the University of Toronto's structual lab, I assisted in

During my first few weeks there, I was also assigned with producing AutoCAD drawings for Zahra and Farhadâ€™s test setup.  It was relatively easy since I learnt AutoCAD in school. Later on, Farhad asked me to produce a 3D model from a 2D plan. This task was more challenging, both technically and visually, but I managed to do it in about a week, having to learn some of the software tools from scratch.
