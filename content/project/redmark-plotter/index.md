Each year, the corrosion prevention team at TC Energy has to produce hundreds of drawings with the location of thousands of cathodic protection devices to be installed. This task is estimated to take more than 200 hours annualy. The task is semi-automated through Excel using VBA programming, and the user interface of the program is shown in Figure 1.

The program asks the user to trace the lines on the drawing and identify its location. Then, the program search through the database for locations of cathodic protection devices, selects the devices in that line's location, and plots them onto the engineering redmark drawing. The resulting redmark drawing is shown in Figure 2.
