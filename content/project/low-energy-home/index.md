Through the various components in this proposed design, the team wishes to convey the values stated in our initial design philosophy. Through the implementation of solar power, low-energy HVAC systems and high performance thermal insulating materials, the team has designed a net-zero house that can self-sustain. Through the research and implementation of exterior fin panels, domestic water heat recovery systems and strategically placed components such as the garage and windows, the team is applying some of the most state of the art technologies to the design. Through extensive research on practicality regarding the various building components and materials used in the design, as well as conducting a conservative cost estimation, the team has ensured that the proposed design is at a high degree of feasibility. Through the creation of detailed section drawings, integration drawings, floor plans and energy performance calculations of various components, the team provided detailed specifications for greater clarity in conveying our proposed design. Finally, we conducted our design with the users in mind every step of the way. We considered their behaviours, and their need for a comfortable, practical and aesthetically pleasing place to call home.

The method first constructs a temporal storage profile of stored energy, based on how storage charges and discharges in response to renewable generation and load demand. The storage is sized according to the largest cumulative charge or discharge in the profile. In essence, the storage profile represents how storage is utilized within a given system, and the method sizes optimal storage to maximize that profile, such that storage utilization is maximized, and unutilized or wasted storage is eliminated. Maximizing storage utilization also maximizes renewable consumption and minimizes load shedding, as storage utilization is the temporal transfer of energy from renewable generation to load demand.

The proposed method is extended iteratively to account for storage's energy and power limits, and energy leakage. Two solar-battery case studies demonstrate the method. The first study shows that optimally sized storage does not have wasted capacity due to over-sizing, nor cause energy deficits due to under-sizing. The second case study shows increasing the storage size reduces the marginal increase in energy provided by storage, indicating diminishing returns.

The diminishing return thresholds are defined by the largest daily and annual storage designs. The result shows the largest daily design only requires 3% of the annual design's storage size, but provides 80% of the energy provided by the annual design. The proposed method can be used as a decision support tool for energy analysts, to determine required storage capacity when coupled with known renewable generation and load demand.
