The permit tracker is programmed using VBA in Excel. The user inputs sites of interest, and the program identifies the associated permit status via SharePoint, and compares it with the construction schedule. The tracker enables project managers to facilitate concurrent progression in constructions and permit applications across hundreds of sites, by creating an automated tracker that monitors permit status and construction schedules. The tracker's user interface is shown in Figure 1.
