As part of my responsibilities at TC Energy, I managed the MOC (Management of Change) process, which documents changes to project scope, schedule, and cost. To streamline this process, I developed a search program using Excel VBA. This program facilitates the efficient management of MOCs by searching for related documents across multiple Excel files on SharePoint, serving as a one-stop-shop for MOC management. Additionally, it aids in generating MOC summary reports for engineers and project managers, contributing to their end-of-year reports. The program allows users to search for multiple subjects simultaneously, and the user interface is displayed in Figure 1.

An example search result is depicted in Figure 2. As can be seen, the program can search through multiple Excels containing MOCs from different years.

The user interface for linking other Excels on SharePoint and copying these files for offline use is displayed in Figure 3.
