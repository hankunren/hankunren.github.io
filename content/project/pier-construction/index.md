As part of my undergraduate research fellowship at the University of Toronto's structual lab, I assisted in the construction of steel reinforced concrete pier for structural research. I safely operated band saws, cutters, benders for cutting and shaping the steel rebars. The steel cagings are tied together using steel wires. Then, rebar surfaces are sanded for glueing the strain gauges. The finished cagings are shown in Figure 1.

The concrete forms are assebled, and cagings are loaded into the the forms, as shown in Figure 2.
