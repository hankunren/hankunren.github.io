summary: Presentation on solar and storage sizing given at the ECEEE conference.
abstract: 'In alignment with the Paris Agreement, Oxfordshire county in the United Kingdom aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. Renewable energy help achieve this target by reducing the reliance on carbon-intensive grid electricity. Thus, this research seeks to determine the optimal solar generation and lithium battery storage size to reduce building grid electricity reliance. The analysis starts with modeling the hourly electricity demand. The model uses Elexon building electricity settlement profiles, and assembles them into the hourly demand profile according to the quantity and types of buildings in Oxfordshire. Then, the hourly solar generation is modeled using Pfenninger and Staffell method. Solar photovoltaic and lithium batteries are sized using an iterative method. First, the method iterates through the solar size search range. At each solar size, the method then iterates through the storage size search range. The renewable system is simulated at each iteration using hourly demand and generation data with a simplified system setup and the conventional operation strategy. The sizing method outputs combinations of solar size, battery size, and the resulting grid electricity consumption. The levelized cost of electricity for each combination is calculated, and the lowest cost combination is the optimal sizing. Solar and battery costs are projected from 2019 to 2100, and the optimal sizing is calculated for each year. The result shows that solar generation is cheap but not as flexible as the grid. Battery storage can provide flexibility, but it is too expensive and therefore not utilized. Thus, the optimal solar system is sized to only meet the demand during peak generation, reducing excess generation that cannot be stored. However, as solar and battery prices continue to drop, they will take up greater portions of the energy system, and reduce more grid electricity demand.'
